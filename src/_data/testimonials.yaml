    quote: Coach Ebener was one of the best coaches that I ever had. With her, she
      helped me become a much better athlete. With tough love and with a diverse
      training regiment, she always kept me on my toes. She didn’t just make me
      a better athlete, though- she helped me become a better person and was
      ALWAYS there for me whether it was about our season or about
      personal  issues I might have been going through. Coach Ebener is a person
      that you’ll cherish forever as a coach AND as a friend.

    quote: "I have been training with Coach Ebener for the past year and she has
      strategically helped me develop my distance running. I was a new runner
      and she was an awesome coach that gave me the confidence I needed to start
      a new sport. Coach breaks everything down about the process of running
      including the importance nutrition and recovery. She is a great person and
      I would recommend her for any athlete looking to take their running to the
      next level. "

    quote: "I worked with Coach Ebener after having been running for years but never
      reaching the goals I had wanted. Prior to working with Coach, I had run
      three marathons with the goal of hitting a Boston qualifying time, with a
      PR of 3:30:51. Always falling shy of the 3:30:00 time that I needed I
      decided to work with Coach Ebener.   My experience with her was very
      positive. I learned a lot about “how to train” not just going out for my
      long runs. She started by asking me a variety of questions and having me
      do some time trials to get a sense of where we would be starting together.
      I really appreciated the custom workout plan that worked around my work
      schedule.  Being a disciplined person it was never a problem for me to get
      out the door. However not having the stress of coming up with my workouts
      was fantastic. Coach was amazing about sending a text at least a couple
      times a week to ask how I was feeling or how a specific workout felt. She
      really used my feedback to adjust workouts if I was feeling a little under
      the weather or it seemed like my body needed more recovery.  After going
      through a 6 month training cycle together marathon day came and I hit a
      new PR, 3:23:52. Cutting off almost 7minutes and hitting well under the
      3:30:00 time I had been grasping for.  In summary Coach Ebener is an
      amazing coach and even more amazing human. She cares about her athletes
      and treats them as humans and not just a name. Understanding that things
      come up and we may need to make adjustments but still pushing you in order
      to help you meet your goals. "
